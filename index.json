Methods to quantify soil degradation due to contamination on a large area with a proper domain are needed and must be studied and developed. Proximal and remote sensing techniques are essential tools, well-suited for surveying large areas, and monitoring soil contamination at a high temporal and spatial interval. Recently developed and forthcoming satellites also dedicated to land monitoring and provide inimitable data streams, which have potential of soil contamination detection. This study peruses the potential of spectroscopy methods in various domains to assess selected soil contaminants including potentially toxic elements and petroleum hydrocarbons from reflectance information, plus a preliminary review of the new generation orbital Earth observation sensors. An aim is to review the means to do so from spaceborne sensors, which are considered to be state-of-the-art Earth orbit observation technologies. This review will help to answer the question: how can spectral information from proximal and remote sensing techniques in different domains be used for soil contamination modelling? This direction will pave the way for soil contamination monitoring using these techniques.\nI was involved in several projects related to monitoring soil contaminations using remote sensing :\n A review: Monitoring of Selected Soil Contaminants using Proximal and Remote Sensing Techniques: Background, State-of-the-Art and Future Perspectives read it Estimation of Potentially Toxic Elements Contamination in Anthropogenic Soils on a Brown Coal Mining Dumpsite by Reflectance Spectroscopy: A Case Study read it Comparing Different Data Preprocessing Methods for Monitoring Soil Heavy Metals Based on Soil Spectral Features read it  ","date":1559384900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559384900,"objectID":"19e0802b03c837cadb86cc28dc393fa9","permalink":"https://saberioon.github.io/project/soil_science/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T12:28:20+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/soil_science/","section":"project","summary":"Soil degradation includes a number of processes, ranging from soil erosion to soil contamination, which reduce the capability of soil to work as a base for vegetation roots.

Also quality assurance has gradually received more attention by both producers and consumers. Thus, fish producers are exploring all possible approaches for improving the productivity and profitability. Monitoring of fish state and behaviour during cultivation may help to improve profitability for producers and also reduce the threat of severe loss because of disease and stress incidents. It is necessary to evaluate and measure quality of fish products in accurate, fast and objective way for meeting the different demands of the fish‐processing industry after harvesting. Traditional methods are usually time‐consuming, expensive, laborious and invasive. Using rapid, inexpensive and noninvasive methods is therefore important and desirable. Optical sensors and machine vision system provide the possibility of developing faster, cheaper and noninvasive methods for in situ and after harvesting monitoring of quality in aquaculture.\nOne of my main focus is addressing application of machine vision systems in aquaculture.
