Also quality assurance has gradually received more attention by both producers and consumers. Thus, fish producers are exploring all possible approaches for improving the productivity and profitability. Monitoring of fish state and behaviour during cultivation may help to improve profitability for producers and also reduce the threat of severe loss because of disease and stress incidents. It is necessary to evaluate and measure quality of fish products in accurate, fast and objective way for meeting the different demands of the fish‐processing industry after harvesting. Traditional methods are usually time‐consuming, expensive, laborious and invasive. Using rapid, inexpensive and noninvasive methods is therefore important and desirable. Optical sensors and machine vision system provide the possibility of developing faster, cheaper and noninvasive methods for in situ and after harvesting monitoring of quality in aquaculture.\nOne of my main focus is addressing application of machine vision systems in aquaculture.
